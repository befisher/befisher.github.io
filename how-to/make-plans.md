## Tips

Plans consist of things that we have to do, we want to do, we desire to do, etc and you may be puzzled when making a big plan such as your yearly plan. Here are some tips that may hint you a bit to make your plans.

0. **List your goals.** That is to say note down what you want to do and what you want to be. But on the same time, you should be clear about the reasons. It is easy to forget the strong passion of how much you want to do this and therefore give up. You can learn from one of the persons you admire. For example, follow their blogs, Github projects, timeline. ..

0. **Clarify Yearly Keywords.** Clarify your yearly/monthly/periodically keywords and take efforts on it when doing things. Step forward a little at a time. You may like to learn broader, study harder, research deeper for your 4-year university learning life.

0. **Make Unsorted Plans.** You may feel easy and passionate to follow the plans sorted by your passion rather than deadlines. So make plans by items/tasks/goals and then write the details down.

0. **Think About What You May Get** Be positive about your plans. Sometimes you will find it more attractive when you are thinking that you have the privilege/chance to do so rather than you have to do so. You can either treat buying a gift to your friends as a task on your schedule to be done or just see it as a good chance to communicate with your friends afterward. Thinking positively and thinking about what you will get/learn/experience may help make your plans easier.

0. **[Write S.M.A.R.T. Plans][article-writing-smart-goals]** Often your plans may be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Results-focused, Time-bound. You may think about the aspects that you did not cover.
