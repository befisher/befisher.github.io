# Personal Learning Tree

> Created by Fisher at 16:54 on 2016-12-29.

[//]: # (About this article.)

This article is mainly talking about my(Fisher) personal learning experience of **Internet Application Development** and the 'learning tree' below is grouped by Topics and each group then is sorted by alphabet.

An Item with ~~Strike-Through-mark~~ is what I do not recommend personally, and I do not mean to attack or insult anybody by doing this.

### The Purpose of This Article

Living in the world where awesome things come up every day, we are supposed to follow it up but chances are that we may forget something we have learned early and just missed it forever. The list helps me figure out what to do next and keep me going.

I also wish this list could give you a hint if you are a newbie at Internet Application Development by coincidence.

Since it is just a simple list of what I've heard of, used, or learned personally, do not be so serious on some detail :)
