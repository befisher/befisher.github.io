<p>I have been asked for many times to introduce myself and what my hobbies are. I do not want to talking about the major again and again. Mentioning hobby, however, it is a bit hard to pose some hobbies and talk a lot about them in a short time.</p>
<p>I do have things to do when I am bored or when I just want to let time go but simply I am not clear about what my hobbies are exactly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define+hobby" title="Definition: Hobby">Hobby</a> means an activity done regularly in one&#39;s leisure time for pleasure.</p>
<p>After thinking hard for a little while and with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hobbies" title="List of Hobbies">this help</a>, I realized my hobbies are roller skating, do it yourself, web surfing :), and some more.</p>
