<p>Today I was asked &quot;What I do during the weekends&quot; and with no more time thinking I simply replied &quot;There are homework assignments&quot;.</p>
<p>Presently, people get used to be busy and this may cause some problems:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><strong>We do not have enough time to do reflections.</strong> It is generally believed that making a brief plan before doing something and doing reflections at the end of the day will be helpful. Being occupied all the time, however, we may forget to do so.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Forget some things you care about.</strong></p>
<p>Bing occupied, one may forget to say &quot;thank you&quot;, clean the dormitory/room, have dinner :(, do listen to a music, plan the future, writing a letter, read a poem, watch the news, learn something new(Ex. A Language), or enjoy the hobbies. We doing something because we like it, or we are expected to do so, or just because it is needed to be done, or else.</p>
<p>Often here remains a choosing problem: what to do and what not, which means we are doing something at the expense of losing the opportunity to do others that may be attractive, helpful, or thrilling.</p>
<p>It is likely that one may spend too much on doing something awful and boring and forget something he or she really care about.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Forget the big picture.</strong> We may ignore the big picture occasionally when doing what we are focusing on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
