# My Hobbies

> Saturday, 4th March, 2017, 18:54 PM

I have been asked for many times to introduce myself and what my hobbies are. I do not want to talking about the major again and again. Mentioning hobby, however, it is a bit hard to pose some hobbies and talk a lot about them in a short time.

I do have things to do when I am bored or when I just want to let time go but simply I am not clear about what my hobbies are exactly.

[Hobby][google-define-hobby] means an activity done regularly in one's leisure time for pleasure.

After thinking hard for a little while and with [this help][wiki-list-of-hobbies], I realized my hobbies are roller skating, do it yourself, web surfing :), and some more.
