# Risks of Being Occupied Always

*Time Management, Planning, Choosing, Growing*

Today I was asked "What I do during the weekends" and with no more time thinking I simply replied "There are homework assignments".

Presently, people get used to be busy and this may cause some problems:

- **We do not have enough time to do reflections.** It is generally believed that making a brief plan before doing something and doing reflections at the end of the day will be helpful. Being occupied all the time, however, we may forget to do so.

- **Forget some things you care about.**

 Bing occupied, one may forget to say "thank you", clean the dormitory/room, have dinner :(, do listen to a music, plan the future, writing a letter, read a poem, watch the news, learn something new(Ex. A Language), or enjoy the hobbies. We doing something because we like it, or we are expected to do so, or just because it is needed to be done, or else.

 Often here remains a choosing problem: what to do and what not, which means we are doing something at the expense of losing the opportunity to do others that may be attractive, helpful, or thrilling.

 It is likely that one may spend too much on doing something awful and boring and forget something he or she really care about.

- **Forget the big picture.** We may ignore the big picture occasionally when doing what we are focusing on.
